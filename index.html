                    <p> Welcome back to my blog about linguistics in the world of Game of Thrones! Last post we discussed the phonetics of Dothraki. 
                        This post will be a little different than the one about Dothraki because we've got less to work with in terms of Petersons intentions. 
                        In our last post we examined what were Petersons goals at every step of creating Dothraki’s phonetic system with the help of his book. 
                        In this post we’ll be examining some of those same things in High Valyrian and trying to reason out why he would do some of these things. 
                        Today were mostly going to be looking at High Valyrian with a tiny bit of Astapori and Mereneese thrown in.</p>

                    <h4>What is Valyrian and Who Speaks it?</h4>
                    <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.fantasticmaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Where_is_Valyria_2.png" alt="where is Valyria">
                    <p>
                        High Valyrian is a bit like Latin. It's no longer anyone’s native language, other languages are descended from it and the languages that are descended
                         from it are all pretty different from each other. It’s a dead language; the people who speak High Valyrian tend to learn it for religious or educational
                          purposes. On the other hand, the other various forms of Valyrian are normal, living languages. Low Valyrian is spoken in the Free Cities and is split 
                          into two main categories with nine different versions. Ghiscari Valyrian is spoken in Slavers Bay. It’s split into New Ghis and Slaver’s Bay Valyrian
                           which includes Mereenese, Astapori and Yunkish. After High Valyrian, Astapori and Mereenese are the most built up types of the language.

                    <h4>Starting Points for Peterson</h4>
                    <p>Although I brought up the comparison to Latin, it seemed to be something that Peterson wanted to avoid. Unlike Dothraki where there were over 50 words found in the books,
                         High Valyrian had three phrases and a few names. The phrases were “valar morghulis”, “valar dohaeris” and “dracarys” meaning all men must die, all men must serve and
                          dragon fire, respectively. Peterson was fine with the first two phrases and later used them to help form the language’s conjunction system, however “dracarys” sounded
                           a little too close to Latin for Peterson’s comfort. He couldn’t get rid of the word so instead he made it an independent lexeme. Nothing is derived from it and no
                            other word in the language sounds like it. From these phrases Peterson also knew he would have to choose what sounds /ae/ and /gh/ make in his language.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Goals and Guidance</h4>
                    <p>Peterson wasn’t given the same instruction of making the language sound “harsh” or “foreign” that he was for Dothraki. Ultimately, Valyrian does sound foreign, but that 
                        is expected of any language that doesn’t share the same language family. This lack of guidance made High Valyrian both easier and harder to create than Dothraki. On the 
                        one hand, Peterson could pretty much do what he wanted as long as the actors would be able to pronounce it. On the other hand, there wasn’t as much guidance of what the 
                        language should sound like. He did seem to have a self set goal of making sure that it didn’t sound like Latin in any way, but that was it.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Consonants</h4>
                    <p>Just like with Dothraki, we're going to start by looking at High Valyrian consonants.</p>

                    <h4>What English Has and High Valyrian Lacks</h4>
                    <p>
                        High Valyrian is missing a few sounds that we have in English. It lacks the glottal stop [ʔ], the voiceless<sup>1</sup> labiodental<sup>2</sup>  fricative<sup>3</sup> 
                        [f], the voiced dental fricative [ð], the voiceless postalveolar fricative [ʃ], the alveolar approximant [ɹ]. Some sounds are dialect dependent like the velar nasal [ŋ] 
                        or the alveolar tap [ɾ]. Same with the sound that is written as /j/<sup>4</sup> . It varies between being the palatal approximant [j], the voiceless postalveolar affricate [ʒ], and 
                        the voiced postalveolar affricate [ʤ]. In English we have all of these sounds as separate sounds, a Valyrian speaker would probably just have one.
                    </p>

                    <h4>What High Valyrian Has and English Lacks</h4>
                    <p>
                        Like Dothraki Valyrian has some sounds that English doesn’t. It has a palatal nasal [ɲ] written as ñ which is found in Spanish in words like Español. 
                        It has a voiceless uvular stop [q] just like the one we discussed in Dothraki. This sound is actually found in some dialects of English, like Australian (ex: caught),
                         just not in American English. It has the voiced velar fricative [ɣ] written as gh and pronounced like the ghayn in Arabic. The closest English equivalent to the letter 
                         is the way r is pronounced in Paris by someone with a proper French accent. Valyrian also has a voiced lateral palatal approximant [ʎ] written as lj and pronounced like
                          the lli sequence in the word million. Its rhotic sounds are a voiceless alveolar trill [r̥] written as rh and a voiced alveolar trill [r] found in words like perro in
                           Spanish. In some dialects the voiced alveolar trill becomes an alveolar tap instead. Below is a link to a voiceless alveolar trill.

                    <h4>Loanwords and Loaned Sounds</h4>
                    <p>
                        Valyrian has several sounds that are borrowed from other languages, some from Dothraki. This includes the velar fricative [x], written as kh, which is often pronounced 
                        as /k/ or /h/ by speakers, just like in English. We discussed in the Dothraki post how Peterson knew American fans would have trouble with the [x] sound. He suspected 
                        that they would pronounce it like /k/ or possibly /h/, just like in Valyrian. This wasn’t just done in Valyrian to make the actors lives easier. Peterson is creating 
                        worldbuilding in the language itself. He’s saying: this sound only appears in loanwords, most people don’t even bother to pronounce it correctly, but you can find it in 
                        some sentences because cultures interact with each other. Another sound borrowed from Dothraki is the voiceless dental fricative [θ]. It’s written as th and often 
                        pronounced as /t/. [ʃ] is found in loanwords and typically pronounced as /s/ although some speakers pronounce it as /sr/. [f], written as /vh/, is also found in loanwords
                        and pronounced /p/ or /v/ depending on the dialect. The same idea of cultures interacting leading to the mispronunciation of sounds can be said for these other sounds also.
                         We get some of these loaned sounds from languages that we don’t really know, as well as the ones that we do.

                    <h4>Long and Short Vowels</h4>
                    <p>
                        High Valyrian only has six vowels. Like in English these vowels can be long or short vowels. Unlike in English vowel length can change the meaning of the word. 
                        This is true in High Valyrian, however in Astapori Valyrian and potentially other types of Valyrian there are no long vowels. High Valyrian has an unrounded<sup>6</sup> front
                         close vowel [y] that we don’t have in English. However, many modern speakers of Valyrian simply pronounce this vowel the same as [i]. It’s unclear if this lack of
                          distinction is to show the change in the language over time or because the actors struggled to pronounce [y] correctly. In English both the close and mid unrounded
                           front vowels are rounded, however in Valyrian they’re not.

                    <h4>Diphthongs</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are two categories of diphthongs<sup>7</sup> in High Valyrian: rising and falling. Falling diphthongs are more official than rising diphthongs.
                         This just means if diphthongs are mentioned without a qualification it refers to falling diphthongs. Falling diphthongs end in /e/ or /o/ and are considered 
                         long vowels when they occur. Rising diphthongs, or on-glide diphthongs, begin with /i/ or /u/ and their length is dependent on the length of the last vowel in 
                         the word. Two vowels can occur in a row without being diphthongs. The vowels are just pronounced separately. This is most commonly found in the combinations /aē/<sup>8</sup> 
                         and /aō/. There is a possible inconsistency with the combination /ao/ which can be pronounced as a dipthong or as two separate vowels. This has only been seen in 
                         the word “daor “ or not. It can be pronounced [dao̯r] or [da.ˈor]. The last word in this clip is the term “daor”, try to figure out how it’s pronounced here.

                        </audio></P>
                        Things like giving vowel length meaning and making the length of one vowel dependent on another don’t just help differentiate the language from English (and Latin), 
                        but also help create a fullness to the language.  When you learn a new language in school you learn tons of rules that seem ridiculous, especially since after every 
                        rule you learn, you learn the exception. Languages that have evolved over time have many rules and many inconsistencies and here High Valyrian evokes that.

                    <h4>Syllable Weight</h4>
                    <p>
                        Stress in High Valyrian is dependent on syllable weight. A syllable in High Valyrian is heavy if:
                        <ul>
                            <li>It contains a long vowel, a falling diphthong or a long rising diphthong</li>
                            <li>It ends in a consonant</li>
                            <li>When looking at syllable boundaries within words</li>
                            <ul TYPE="square">
                                <li>/rh/, /gh/ and /lj/ all count as singular consonants</li>
                                <li>A stop followed by a liquid or a sibilant count as a single consonant</li>
                                <li>Double consonant like /rr/ are two consonants</li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>
                        So, in the word “bāmves” [m] and [v] count as two separate consonants, but in “ābrar” b and r are part of the same consonant since it’s a stop followed by a liquid.
                        <br>
                        Light syllables in High Valyrian are ones that end in short vowels (including diphthongs).

                    <h4>Stress</h4>
                    <p>Stress in High Valyrian is different than stress in English or in Dothraki. In English we have variable stress which means that the position of stress in a word isn’t
                         predictable. In Dothraki the ultimate or penultimate syllable in a word is always stressed. In High Valyrian stress depends on the type of word, vowel coordination or
                          syllable weight.</p>
                    <p>Stress is always syllable final if the word is an imperative verb like “kelītī́s” or halt!, or if the word was lengthened to for coordination like in the Targaryen
                        motto “pérzys ānogā́r” (which means fire and blood). For the remainder of words, we look to syllable weight. If the penultimate syllable and the antepenultimate 
                        syllable are both light, the stress is placed on the penultimate syllable. If the penultimate syllable is heavy, no matter the weight of the antepenultimate syllable 
                        the stress is on the penultimate syllable. If the penultimate syllable is light and the antepenultimate syllable is heavy the stress is on the antepenultimate syllable.
                         However, if the word is a loan word it keeps its original stress.</p>
                    <p>Let’s take the word “dōrenka”, which means made of stone, as an example. First rewrite the word as [doːreŋka]. There are three syllables [doː | reŋ | ka]. 
                        The antepenultimate syllable contains a long vowel which means that it’s a heavy syllable. The penultimate syllable ends in a consonant which means that it’s also
                         a heavy syllable that. So, if we look at the rules that means that the stress is placed on the penultimate syllable, giving us [doːˈreŋka]<sup>9</sup> . But for the word khalēsi
                          which is a loan word from Dothraki we wouldn’t look to these rules, we would use the Dothraki ones and place the stress on the penultimate syllable making it [xaˈleːsi]. </p>

                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>  
                    <p>Like with Dothraki, Peterson doesn’t want his American viewers to be hearing High Valyrian, or any type of Valyrian, and thinking “this sounds familiar”. He makes 
                        sure to not use certain sounds like the alveolar approximant [ɹ] also known as the American “r”. Just like in Dothraki the stress patterns differ from those in English 
                        to help give the language a different rhythm. There are enough sound added into the language that it’s easy to make sure they’re frequently used. That same idea of high
                         frequency use of foreign sounds worked out in the best way possible, with the most commonly known High Valyrian phrase, “valar morghulis” containing a sound that isn’t 
                         found in English. Peterson stuck to the same principles he used to create a foreign sounding language in Dothraki, to create one in Valyrian. Only here he went beyond 
                         one language and created an entire language family, filled with history and dialects. In my next blog post I’ll be discussing how Astapori and Mereenese Valyrian 
                         phonology have changed over time and therefore, differ from High Valyrian.</p>

                        <li>If your vocal folds vibrate while making a sound it’s voiced, if they don’t its voiceless</li>
                        <li>This refers to the place of articulation, or where your tongue is in your mouth while you make a sound</li>
                        <li>This refers to the manner of articulation, or how the air escapes from your mouth while you make a sound</li>
                        <li>[x] is used for narrow transcription, when as much detail as necessary is included, /x/ is used for broad transcription which is 
                            just the basic indication of a sound without any details. Here I’m using /j/ because we don’t know how exactly I’s pronounced.</li>
                        <li>The ː symbols after a vowel represents a long vowel</li>
                        <li>Roundness refers to the position of the lips while making a vowel sound. It’s also called lip rounding. In most languages front vowels
                             tend to be unrounded (relaxed lips) and back vowels tend to be rounded (lips forming a circular opening)</li>
                        <li>A sound formed by adding two vowels together, like the oi in choice. It starts closer to one vowel and ends closer to the other</li>
                        <li>The line above the ē is called a macron and is a symbol of a long vowel </li>
                        <li>ˈ is the symbol for stress</li>
