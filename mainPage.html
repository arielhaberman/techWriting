                    <h4>Intro </h4>
                    
                    <p> Welcome back to my blog about linguistics in the world of Game of Thrones! Last post we discussed the phonetics of Dothraki. 
                        This post will be a little different than the one about Dothraki because we've got less to work with in terms of Petersons intentions. 
                        In our last post we examined what were Petersons goals at every step of creating Dothraki’s phonetic system with the help of his book. 
                        In this post we’ll be examining some of those same things in High Valyrian and trying to reason out why he would do some of these things. 
                        Today were mostly going to be looking at High Valyrian with a tiny bit of Astapori and Mereneese thrown in.</p>

                    <h4>What is Valyrian and Who Speaks it?</h4>
                    <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.fantasticmaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Where_is_Valyria_2.png" alt="where is Valyria">
                    <p>
                        High Valyrian is a bit like Latin. It's no longer anyone’s native language, other languages are descended from it and the languages that are descended
                         from it are all pretty different from each other. It’s a dead language; the people who speak High Valyrian tend to learn it for religious or educational
                          purposes. On the other hand, the other various forms of Valyrian are normal, living languages. Low Valyrian is spoken in the Free Cities and is split 
                          into two main categories with nine different versions. Ghiscari Valyrian is spoken in Slavers Bay. It’s split into New Ghis and Slaver’s Bay Valyrian
                           which includes Mereenese, Astapori and Yunkish. After High Valyrian, Astapori and Mereenese are the most built up types of the language.

                    <h4>Starting Points for Peterson</h4>
                    <p>Although I brought up the comparison to Latin, it seemed to be something that Peterson wanted to avoid. Unlike Dothraki where there were over 50 words found in the books,
                         High Valyrian had three phrases and a few names. The phrases were “valar morghulis”, “valar dohaeris” and “dracarys” meaning all men must die, all men must serve and
                          dragon fire, respectively. Peterson was fine with the first two phrases and later used them to help form the language’s conjunction system, however “dracarys” sounded
                           a little too close to Latin for Peterson’s comfort. He couldn’t get rid of the word so instead he made it an independent lexeme. Nothing is derived from it and no
                            other word in the language sounds like it. From these phrases Peterson also knew he would have to choose what sounds /ae/ and /gh/ make in his language.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Goals and Guidance</h4>
                    <p>Peterson wasn’t given the same instruction of making the language sound “harsh” or “foreign” that he was for Dothraki. Ultimately, Valyrian does sound foreign, but that 
                        is expected of any language that doesn’t share the same language family. This lack of guidance made High Valyrian both easier and harder to create than Dothraki. On the 
                        one hand, Peterson could pretty much do what he wanted as long as the actors would be able to pronounce it. On the other hand, there wasn’t as much guidance of what the 
                        language should sound like. He did seem to have a self set goal of making sure that it didn’t sound like Latin in any way, but that was it.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Consonants</h4>
                    <p>Just like with Dothraki, we're going to start by looking at High Valyrian consonants.</p>

                    <h4>What English Has and High Valyrian Lacks</h4>
                    <p>
                        High Valyrian is missing a few sounds that we have in English. It lacks the glottal stop [ʔ], the voiceless<sup>1</sup> labiodental<sup>2</sup>  fricative<sup>3</sup> 
                        [f], the voiced dental fricative [ð], the voiceless postalveolar fricative [ʃ], the alveolar approximant [ɹ]. Some sounds are dialect dependent like the velar nasal [ŋ] 
                        or the alveolar tap [ɾ]. Same with the sound that is written as /j/ . It varies between being the palatal approximant [j], the voiceless postalveolar affricate [ʒ], and 
                        the voiced postalveolar affricate [ʤ]. In English we have all of these sounds as separate sounds, a Valyrian speaker would probably just have one.

                    <h4>What High Valyrian Has and English Lacks</h4>
                    <p>
                        Like Dothraki Valyrian has some sounds that English doesn’t. It has a palatal nasal [ɲ] written as ñ which is found in Spanish in words like Español. 
                        It has a voiceless uvular stop [q] just like the one we discussed in Dothraki. This sound is actually found in some dialects of English, like Australian (ex: caught),
                         just not in American English. It has the voiced velar fricative [ɣ] written as gh and pronounced like the ghayn in Arabic. The closest English equivalent to the letter 
                         is the way r is pronounced in Paris by someone with a proper French accent. Valyrian also has a voiced lateral palatal approximant [ʎ] written as lj and pronounced like
                          the lli sequence in the word million. Its rhotic sounds are a voiceless alveolar trill [r̥] written as rh and a voiced alveolar trill [r] found in words like perro in
                           Spanish. In some dialects the voiced alveolar trill becomes an alveolar tap instead. Below is a link to a voiceless alveolar trill.

                    <h4>Loanwords and Loaned Sounds</h4>
                    <p>
                        Valyrian has several sounds that are borrowed from other languages, some from Dothraki. This includes the velar fricative [x], written as kh, which is often pronounced 
                        as /k/ or /h/ by speakers, just like in English. We discussed in the Dothraki post how Peterson knew American fans would have trouble with the [x] sound. He suspected 
                        that they would pronounce it like /k/ or possibly /h/, just like in Valyrian. This wasn’t just done in Valyrian to make the actors lives easier. Peterson is creating 
                        worldbuilding in the language itself. He’s saying: this sound only appears in loanwords, most people don’t even bother to pronounce it correctly, but you can find it in 
                        some sentences because cultures interact with each other. Another sound borrowed from Dothraki is the voiceless dental fricative [θ]. It’s written as th and often 
                        pronounced as /t/. [ʃ] is found in loanwords and typically pronounced as /s/ although some speakers pronounce it as /sr/. [f], written as /vh/, is also found in loanwords
                        and pronounced /p/ or /v/ depending on the dialect. The same idea of cultures interacting leading to the mispronunciation of sounds can be said for these other sounds also.
                         We get some of these loaned sounds from languages that we don’t really know, as well as the ones that we do.
